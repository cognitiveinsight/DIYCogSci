# DIYSciThai
DIYSciThai was an Open Science workshop taught in Bangkok, Thailand in June 2016. This workshop is the basis of an open science initiative to provide an integrative curriculum to teach cognitive science through experiential learning. Its pillars are hardware hacking, software development, and basic cognitive science. The goal of this workshop was to build research tools (e.g. eye-trackers and EEG headsets) from open-source hardware and low-cost electronics, and demonstrate how these hardware tools are useful to study human behavior and physiology.
